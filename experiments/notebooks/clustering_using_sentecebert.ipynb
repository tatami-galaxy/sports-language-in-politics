I thought maybe heat caused this, but there is no heater in my closet and it never became overly warm inside. There seems to be a layer of film on the outside of the lens, which I'm guessing was the layer that turned red during the day and clear at night. Anyone have an idea what caused this? And before you ask, there was none of that new protection plastic film on the outside of the lens. \\n\\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/pmqi3q7iz/IMG_4655.jpg\\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/cssgadu3f/IMG_4653.jpg\\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/lz5p0jt0b/IMG_4652.jpg\\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/5y7rnmx45/IMG_4650.jpg</td>\n",

I would hope that after the 2 games this weekend Allen will get a start soon.  I can't see them not rotating him in at some point.  Seems like some are thinking this is trying to send a message to Allen, but I really doubt that.  As Elliott is labeled as the starter I don't see him rotating in the press box, but I think they would have to play Allen at some point too.</td>\n",

Now after watching Cody play several games, I have to say he's the most underrated QB in CFB right now. http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/513329/cody-kessler. His ball placement and decision making is exactly what our offense needs to continue to prosper. Since he's staying at USC for another year, we won't know where he'll place in the 2016 draft, but if he manages to fall to late 1st round what would you think if Denver picked him up. Remember, this is the most prolific QB in USC history.</td>\n",

I'm not sure how they set those things up, but assuming his standing reach gets him to the bottom notch, that's gotta be at least a 2 ft vertical.  It's safe to say at his height and length he's probably around 8 and a half feet standing reach. (I'm 6'3 and a half, no where near as gangly as jones + i have a longer neck and my standing reach is about 8'2).

But, [this 900RR](http://dallas.craigslist.org/ndf/mcy/4824532902.html)  caught my eye, and I LOVE early 90's bikes. Especially these in the white/red/blue color scheme.\\n\\nOther than a bad regulator/rectifier and battery, he says it doesn't need anything else. The fairings are beat up, but honestly, I'd probably just replace them with an aftermarket set of the color scheme I prefer.\\n\\nI guess my question to the gurus is...does this seem too good to be true? Nicely fleshed examples seem to go for $2500-$4000. If no big surprises pop up, I could probably get that one sorted for much less than that. What would you do?</td>\n",

The selection committee will still remain intact and they'll still seed all the champions [(all 2014 conference champions for reference)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_season#Conference_champions). But if they go up to a sixteen team bracket they could take in 6 teams as a wild card in addition to the ten conference champions that already secured a spot. What do you guys think, and how you do the College Football Playoff?\\n\\nTLDR: Either a 10 team bracket made up of the champions of all 10 Division 1 FBS conferences, or use a 16 team bracket with the 10 conference champions and 6 other teams chosen as wild cards (for lack of a better term)</td>\n",

Used this scraper: http://bakoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bakoda-Wax-Scraper-ORG-1024x896.jpg\\n\\nThe corner with the edge scraping notch put several long 2ish foot long noticeable scratches in the base, so then I started using the other side of the scraper. The scratches aren't deep and are pretty superficial, but it's kind of annoying. Does this normally happen? Ease my insane mind pwease. Muh OCD. And happy new year!</td>\n",

Victorino seemed to be the unanimous favorite for the role, but injuries kept him off the field. We eventually found a serviceable lead-off hitter in Brock Holt.\\n\\nFurther, we suffered from some serious inconsistency from our young players. Xander Bogaerts often showed signs of greatness, but the pressure seemed to get to him. There were times when [his mind didn't seem to be in the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8JXk_Ch3LY).\\n\\nJBJ is one of the best outfielders I have ever seen, with incredible range and a cannon. However, his incredible fielding was coupled with a bad bat. Honestly, I think he was left at the major league level for too long because of his fielding. He has a long swing, and he needs to work on it.\\...</td>\n",

A 1st round WR should be a #2 or #3. Whoever it is he better be a stud, close to as good as any of last year's 1st round WR. That would then leave Writght and Patterson as our #4 and #5 WR. They are too good and would almost be throwing in the towel of Patterson. Johnson has showed enough for a future role at #2 or #3.\\n\\nThen you'd have to conisder cutting [Jenning contract ](http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/minnesota-vikings/greg-jennings/). We are on the hook for $6m for his signing bonus but save $5m this year and free $22m in space the next two years. I've always been a fan of Jennings and love what he brings here in leadership but with those cap savings it's time to move on. We end up paying him $19m for 2 years. A solid to good FA signing but we can't keep him around and have room for a 1st round rookie.\\n\\...</td>\n",

I love it, because it's incredibly handy to not have to fumble with lock screens to see pace, BUT I am concerned about the kind of accuracy I'm getting.\\n\\nFor example -- here is a segment of a run I did today with the Forerunner 220. It's pretty good, on the correct road and such. However, it's variance seems suspect. I ran that route on the same side of the sidewalk both times. For comparison, I pulled up a previous run from my phone (Galaxy S4) and it was far and away both more precise and accurate. Is this sort of variance normal for a running watch? Is it normal for the level of watch I have? Or is something off and I should give Garmin a shout?\\n\\nThanks all!\\n\\nHere's the album comparing a variance segment from my route: http://imgur.com/a/g5jiZ\\nHere's another one where both the accuracy and the variance seem a little sus...</td>\n",

I kept them in my closet with the rest of my gear. I thought maybe heat caused this, but there is no heater in my closet and it never became overly warm inside. There seems to be a layer of film on the outside of the lens, which I'm guessing was the layer that turned red during the day and clear at night. Anyone have an idea what caused this? And before you ask, there was none of that new protection plastic film on the outside of the lens. \\n\\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/pmqi3q7iz/IMG_4655.jpg\\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/cssgadu3f/IMG_4653.jpg\\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/lz5p0jt0b/IMG_4652.jpg\\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/5y7rnmx45/IMG_4650.jpg   \n",

The 3 captions above me, imho, kinda suck. And I REALLY want to win these tickets. If you'd be so kind as to help me win, that would be awesome.

I would hope that after the 2 games this weekend Allen will get a start soon.  I can't see them not rotating him in at some point.  Seems like some are thinking this is trying to send a message to Allen, but I really doubt that.  As Elliott is labeled as the starter I don't see him rotating in the press box, but I think they would have to play Allen at some point too.     \n",

I hope everyone had a great holiday season!\\n\\nIt's time to vote for the best, the worst, and the WTF!? of the year.\\n\\nGo to /r/TheSmarkees and you'll see several posts.  The big best and worst of the year in wrestling and /r/SquaredCircle. As well as three posts that cover several other categories.  There's small differences between the two, but the rules are similar.  \\n\\n* In the single topic posts make your vote as a top level comment or upvote it if it's already posted.  \\n\\n* In the three posts with several categories you'll see those categories have already been posted.  Reply to that with your vote or upvote that if it's already been said.  Essentially the same as the other topics, but as a second level instead of the first.\\n\\n* **In both cases duplicates will be deleted and ignored.**.\\n\\nPlease try and keep questions or overall discussion in this thread as to keep it out of the voting and this easier to read.\\n\\nThank you, and have fu...   \n",

It runs in a complete circle around the tube and is just above the front derailleur.  Here are two pictures:\\n\\n* [Picture 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04MxMDWraxdQjc2NC1ORjMtTEE/view?usp=sharing)\\n* [Picture 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04MxMDWraxdR2lONGNzUkJ3cEU/view?usp=sharing)\\n\\nWhat say you?  Is there anything I can do about this?  Is it in good enough condition to sell or should I just strip the parts off and save them for a future project? Is there a chance that this isn't a crack and is just damage to the paint?   \n",

Almost failed the road test because the instructor couldn't tell if I had turned them on or not. Not good.\\n\\nI like these LED [Torpedo's from Kuryakyn](http://www.kuryakyn.com/products/4843/torpedo-lights).\\n\\nSo my question is, should I get the standard turn signals for the rear, or the RTB set I can use as running lights? \\n\\nEveryone seems to be on board with running lights = more visible = less likely to die.\\n\\nBut.\\n\\nI ride mostly during the day. My current set up has running lights, and I think that's one of the problems. I think because they are lit up all the time, it's not as obvious when they start blinking. \\n\\nThoughts?\\n\\n   \n",

The 3 captions above me, imho, kinda suck. And I REALLY want to win these tickets. If you'd be so kind as to help me win, that would be awesome. And I'd like to think I'm the only redditor in the top 5.\\n\\nEDIT: Also, as a heads up and if you're feeling generous, you are allowed to vote once every 24 hours. Also, in case this wasn't obvious, WILL OBVI HOLD UP A R/CHICAGOBULLS SIGN. Design suggestions now being accepted.\\n\\nThe caption is here!\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/chicagobulls?v=app_322233087884484&amp;rest=1&amp;app_data=essay%3D696637\\n\\nTL;DR Help me bring reddit to the sexy floor seats in the UNITED CENTER.   \n",

       "369   Hello, folks! \\n\\nThe Standings Game is something I put together every day for this subreddit so we can keep track of our race to a playoff berth. It is essentially a list of the ***most ideal*** results for all NHL games (with respect to Detroit's position in the standings) on a given night. I will only assign ideal outcomes to games that affect the **Eastern Conference standings.**\\n\\nI will also make a note of which games are most important to our current situation in the standings. These will mostly be divisional games, however they can also include games where a team is threatening to remove us from a Wild Card position, or games with a significant statistical impact on Detroit's playoff chances.\\n\\nAt the end of each night's schedule, I will update the list with the actual results, as well as indicate how the game affected our statistical probability of making the playoffs. Games that have an insignificant or near-zero effect on our standings will be denoted with a +/-0.0% va...   \n",

It's the right size and links but I am unsure about the brand. If it's not total garbage I'd like to use it because I'm pretty strapped for cash but if it's terrible I won't use it. http://i83.photobucket.com/albums/j302/DiStUrBeDSmurf2/Mobile%20Uploads/20150101_121328_zpsdf2270f9.jpg   \n",

They both played worse than their season averages this month. I'm guessing due to a bit of luck falling off and missing some key pieces to our team.\\n\\nBreakdown of stats found here. \\n\\nhttp://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8474636&amp;view=splits#&amp;navid=nhl-keymatch\\n\\nhttp://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8471715&amp;view=splits   \n",

Now after watching Cody play several games, I have to say he's the most underrated QB in CFB right now. http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/513329/cody-kessler. His ball placement and decision making is exactly what our offense needs to continue to prosper. Since he's staying at USC for another year, we won't know where he'll place in the 2016 draft, but if he manages to fall to late 1st round what would you think if Denver picked him up. Remember, this is the most prolific QB in USC history.   \n",

(granted, a full replacement would be pretty good reason to finally get an upgrade to a set of Diablo Rosso II's...)   \n",

I'm not sure how they set those things up, but assuming his standing reach gets him to the bottom notch, that's gotta be at least a 2 ft vertical.  It's safe to say at his height and length he's probably around 8 and a half feet standing reach. (I'm 6'3 and a half, no where near as gangly as jones + i have a longer neck and my standing reach is about 8'2).  So, with all these rough ass estimations, 8'6 + 24\" vert = ten and a half feet, or a basic dunk if he can palm the ball.  All from a standing position.   \n",

The one on top is a 5k I did this morning and hit a max of 205. I figured with more running my hr would start to go down. Should I be concerned? The numbers are from a Garmin 620 with the HRM chest strap. I'm 38, 5'10\" and about 165lbs... Would love to hear any thoughts you may have!\\n\\n[Some numbers.

It'd be cool if it had the date, cost, teams involved, and if it's a transfer or loan or what. And as a bonus, it could have a rumours section. Sorry if there are some obvious sites, but thanks in advance!\\n\\n\\nEdit: Found www.transfermarkt.com but if there are any others, please let me know   \n",

But, [this 900RR](http://dallas.craigslist.org/ndf/mcy/4824532902.html)  caught my eye, and I LOVE early 90's bikes. Especially these in the white/red/blue color scheme.\\n\\nOther than a bad regulator/rectifier and battery, he says it doesn't need anything else. The fairings are beat up, but honestly, I'd probably just replace them with an aftermarket set of the color scheme I prefer.\\n\\nI guess my question to the gurus is...does this seem too good to be true? Nicely fleshed examples seem to go for $2500-$4000. If no big surprises pop up, I could probably get that one sorted for much less than that. What would you do?   \n",

       "574                                                 Since there are 10 conferences in the Division 1 FBS we should take the champions of all 10 conferences and put those ten teams be in the College Football Playoff [(Here's a 10 team bracket for refernce)](http://www.printyourbrackets.com/thumbs/10-Team-Single-Seeded.gif). The selection committee will still remain intact and they'll still seed all the champions [(all 2014 conference champions for reference)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_season#Conference_champions). But if they go up to a sixteen team bracket they could take in 6 teams as a wild card in addition to the ten conference champions that already secured a spot. What do you guys think, and how you do the College Football Playoff?\\n\\nTLDR: Either a 10 team bracket made up of the champions of all 10 Division 1 FBS conferences, or use a 16 team bracket with the 10 conference champions and 6 other teams chosen as wild cards (for lack of a better term)   \n",

Used this scraper: http://bakoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bakoda-Wax-Scraper-ORG-1024x896.jpg\\n\\nThe corner with the edge scraping notch put several long 2ish foot long noticeable scratches in the base, so then I started using the other side of the scraper. The scratches aren't deep and are pretty superficial, but it's kind of annoying. Does this normally happen? Ease my insane mind pwease. Muh OCD. And happy new year!   \n",

I imagine the picture will clear up over the next few months.\"*\\n\\n\\n*Asked if it was possible 2015 would be his final season, Rivers responded, \"I guess that's possible. I guess re-signing here after (the year) is also possible ... I guess playing somewhere else is also possible.\"*\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/dec/31/rivers-telesco-chargers-contract/?#article-copy\\n\\n\\n\\nI think its too early to be asking Rivers about contract extensions and the such, he just got done finishing a disappointing season and is completely worn out. If his sentiments are the same in June, then we have a problem.   \n",

Xander Bogaerts often showed signs of greatness, but the pressure seemed to get to him. There were times when [his mind didn't seem to be in the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8JXk_Ch3LY).\\n\\nJBJ is one of the best outfielders I have ever seen, with incredible range and a cannon.

He has a long swing, and he needs to work on it.\\...   \n",

The former owner of the house was an older man who did not keep up with the maintenance of the green and now it needs some work.  It looks like it is made out of some high quality astro turf type material, but there is moss growing through it as well as some other vegetation.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how I can repair/improve it?  My wife wants me to rip it out and seed grass there but I would like to try and fix it before I remove it.\\n\\nHere are 3 pics of the green:  http://imgur.com/2b818iN,wBuZjm3,eSZc1ZT#0   \n",

       "908   Haven't seen anyone mention our depth at WR as a big factor in how we should go forward. If we draft a rookie in the 1st round where does that leave the others in our WR corps? A 1st round WR should be a #2 or #3. Whoever it is he better be a stud, close to as good as any of last year's 1st round WR. That would then leave Writght and Patterson as our #4 and #5 WR. They are too good and would almost be throwing in the towel of Patterson. Johnson has showed enough for a future role at #2 or #3.\\n\\nThen you'd have to conisder cutting [Jenning contract ](http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/minnesota-vikings/greg-jennings/). We are on the hook for $6m for his signing bonus but save $5m this year and free $22m in space the next two years. I've always been a fan of Jennings and love what he brings here in leadership but with those cap savings it's time to move on. We end up paying him $19m for 2 years. A solid to good FA signing but we can't keep him around and have room for a 1st round rookie.\\n\\...   \n",

Next step is to develop players and add new pieces. Hopes Reich stays in SD\\n\\n\\n* Likes Mathews but is going to take time to make a decision on him. Donald Brown will return next year\\n\\n\\n* Oline and run game must improve. Likes Fluker at RT but also could see him at RG. Liked what Watt did at C\\n\\n\\n* Many contracts to extend, is going to make sure Rivers to retire a Charger.

       "966   Hey all -- so like quite a few lucky others, I was able to get a running watch over the holiday season. Prior to this, I have always used my phone to run. I love it, because it's incredibly handy to not have to fumble with lock screens to see pace, BUT I am concerned about the kind of accuracy I'm getting.\\n\\nFor example -- here is a segment of a run I did today with the Forerunner 220. It's pretty good, on the correct road and such. However, it's variance seems suspect. I ran that route on the same side of the sidewalk both times. For comparison, I pulled up a previous run from my phone (Galaxy S4) and it was far and away both more precise and accurate. Is this sort of variance normal for a running watch? Is it normal for the level of watch I have? Or is something off and I should give Garmin a shout?\\n\\nThanks all!\\n\\nHere's the album comparing a variance segment from my route: http://imgur.com/a/g5jiZ\\nHere's another one where both the accuracy and the variance seem a little sus...   \n",

Waterproofing is needed too. I love bright bright lights, sometimes finding a balance is hard.\\n\\n**EDIT**: Just ordered the Blackburn Mars 3.0 Light   \n",

If you know Surftech, there's an outer \"plastic\" layer over the colored part of the board ([also called Exterior Fiberglass Lamination](http://www.surftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Tuflite-natural-tech-cutaway.jpg)). The ding only goes to this \"plastic\" layer.   \n",

       "997   My 2007 CB919 has just over 32,000kms on it and the chain is very close to the end of its life according to the adjustment indicators (ie: chain is stretched). Funnily enough the sprockets are in fantastic condition with very little wear visible. \\n\\nOn another popular motorcycle forum which has a large amount of CB919 riders, they all tend to recommend the DID ERV3 520 chain and a set of sprockets found here: http://www.shop.kyleusa.com/product.sc?productId=459&amp;categoryId=41\\n\\nI can get that set landed for around $350 NZD however I've heard that 520 chains can be risky for a high torque/high capacity bike, with shorter life spans and generally being weaker.

I have 2 extra creddits to give and due to the reddit rules I can only use them as part of this contest so I'll give them to the two highest voted in the contest /u/DJ_Febreeze &amp; /u/Kicker36).

Then I moved to Southern California in September, leaving the bike behind.

My plan was to make it to either Blacksburg and crash on a friends couch or push on through to Knoxville. I had never done a long trip in Winter conditions and managed to make it to Knoxville after a few Starbucks stops to wa...   \n",

That's not really relevant to why I feel like I'd be a weird dad but it brings me to the whole level of just collapsing onto the couch and watching whatever is like modern family , Which is life in pieces. Don't judge me :P\\n\\nWhy are people so afraid of talking about stuff in the family? Or why do people get so weirded out talking about stuff in general? \\n\\nLike Santa, I should probably mention that where I live you usually make a deal with the neighbors and one of them plays Santa and comes over vice versa. So by age 6 I wasn't worried about Santa and whatnot, I was curious who played Santa because obviously everyone in my family was present for his visit and someone was wearing a totally fake mask...\\n\\nFirst experience I had with death was around the same age when my dad had shot a deer and got to see it laid in the trunk of the car. I can't say I remember it extremely well but I remember they eyes on the deer quite well. It looked peaceful. Yes reading that afterwards does look slightly cold but I don't know a better way to describe the eyes, it was fear or sadness, it was at peace :)\\n\\nI'm not sure when I understood how sex works, i can't see myself being older than 8 though. Why is it strange to talk about sex with your children, not children in general.  But like your son or daughter, you know they will have sex, or at least you'd hope they have sex, children and so on... \\n\\nI realise that this is probably only relatable for people that have kids or have thought about this as much as I have...\\n\\nSorry if I'm rambling it was just a philosophical thought :)</td>\n",

The dad started talking faster and all my partner translated was that the dad was trying to say he was very precise and accurate about his research. I said cool I am looking forward to it and we scheduled a call for next week.\\n\\nWhen we hung up my partner asked me not to encourage his dad in his astrology stuff. I asked why and he said his dad has been a lot less logical since he started doing astrology as a hobby. I asked if that is hurting anything. His dad is a doctor, is he prescribing things based off the stars? He said no and chinese medicine often prescribes diet and lifestyle changes before medication anyway. I asked what was so bad about the hobby then, his dad gets joy and the downside is...? He didn't like his dad believing in something not fact based and he said their relationship took a hit so that was a negative. I said that really sounds like a problem with my partner. His dad found something he loves doing and their relationship was already strained at best. My partner held resentment and strained the relationship further. What was causing the strain, the happy dad or the unyielding son? I think he is so critical of his dad and his dad was obviously nervous of asking that he wouldn't have asked if he didn't really enjoy doing research into these things. \\n\\nThere was silence for thought and he said that he will be less critical and thanked me for talking him through my thoughts. He said he realized he was putting his own values and lifestyle on his dad which wasn't fair since his dad was happy, healthy, and independent and those are the most important things. I am happy that I have helped their relationship. There are some bad on the dad's side as well but it's a step to meeting in the middle.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I  work as the librarian for my former elementary school, which operates from preschool to 6th grade.\\n\\nA couple of months ago, I thought it'd be a fun idea to go find my now 8yo nephew's old ducky hand puppet that we used to entertain him when he was small and see if the little ones at the school  would like it.\\n\\nBut when I went to our storage unit and looked in the container with our old toys, the ducky puppet was gone. I don't know what we ever did with it or who has it. So I decided to see if there were any other stuffed animals in there that I could use, and I found my late big sister's old hippo doll.\\n\\nI decided to take this to work with me the following Wednesday, which is the day I have preschool coming to the library. I introduced this doll to the class as \"Mr. Hippo\", an old friend of my sister's whom I brought back here from the jungle.\\n\\nMy routine with him is simple: I read the kids a story, and while I'm reading it I have Mr. Hippo ask questions and make comments about it. Then, I let the teacher decide who was paying attention the best, and that kid gets to hold onto Mr. Hippo for the rest of their class's library visit. I do this with preschool, kindergarten, and 1st grade.\\n\\nAt first, this was a big hit with the little ones, especially preschool. They'd actually talk to this doll as if it were alive, and they'd ask me where he is if they didn't see him.\\n\\nBut lately, the kids have seem to lose interest in Mr. Hippo. I've had a few library visits where I didn't bring him out and nobody seemed to notice or care, and when I do bring him out, they don't seem as enthusiastic as they used to be.\\n\\nOne thing I tried this week that did seem to revive the interest was to hide him and have the kids search for him. I told him he was due for a dentist appointment and he was afraid of going, so he hid somewhere in the library, and I asked them to help me look for him, with the kid who found him getting to hold onto him for the rest of their library visit.\\n\\nThat got the kids interested, but I don't necessarily want to just do that all the time. What are some other ways you think I could make Mr. Hippo interesting again?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I've always been into tattoos and body modifications and I've been tattooing/piercing myself since I was a kid, when I was in high school I spent a few years living in a group home and ended up giving myself between 40 and 50 tattoos with equipment that varied from safety pins mounted in pencils with pen ink to handmade machines with proper needles and ink, eventually I landed an apprenticeship and stopped tattooing myself at the request of the artist teaching me. several years later I turn 18 and begin to draw myself a kickass tattoo to have done by an artist at the shop I was learning at as my first professional tattoo, I spent a long time working on it and between working and juggling all the other aspects of my life at the time the process stretched out and eventually I finished my drawing. a week after i gave them the drawing and we started looking to schedule something coronavirus came and with it came lockdowns and with lockdowns came the temporary closure of tattoo shops, which also stretched out far longer than expected and after the shops reopened life got in the way again and long story short I still havent gotten it done. \\n\\nyesterday was stressful and eventful and last night was pretty rough, today on a whim I remembered a different and much simpler and smaller tattoo design id had in mind for a while and called around some local shops asking about availabilities for a walk in and pretty much everywhere is booked, one place with good reviews and a professional and friendly artist answering calls tells me to call back later so I do and he tells me that it wont be possible today but tomorrow theres an opening and to call back if I'm interested, I thank him and consider waiting till tomorrow and decide to call one last shop  before deciding and as it turns out they have an availability in about two hours.\\n\\nthe woman answering the phone was friendly, but somewhat unprofessional. the website isnt great and I didnt see much artwork from the artists, I also wasnt told which artist would be available. it's also worth noting that this tattoo shop used to be in a space that was a jenky ass tattoo/piercing shop run by methheads back in the day. as you can probably imagine, I was skeptical, but I check the reviews and they're all extremely positive except for one badly written borderline incoherent review from about five years ago, so I call back and make the appointment for the opening that afternoon. \\n\\nwhen I get there their receptionist is friendly and the owner of the shop seems responsible and friendly as well, at this point I'm already a 50$ deposit in and I'm already there so it is what it is,but I'm pleasantly suprised by the place and I talk to the artist and get everything situated and then I'm getting the stencil put on. the artist had drawn a good design based on the references I'd provider and I'm happy with it and from what I see the stencil is placed well so off we go.\\n\\na few minutes in it's clear that this artist isnt very experienced, it's also apparent that the placement is a little bit off and the artist is a little bit awkward with the convorsatiom aspect of the buisness, but at this point we got lines down already and I like the design so it is what it is and in just gonna ride it out, I'm not too picky and shit happens so its whatever. I make some convorsation with the artist and she lights up a little bit sharing her interests and plans and hobbies and shes clearly concentrating on the tattoo and doing her best. we finish up, I payed for the tattoo and gave her a nice tip and compliment her work on my tattoo again and tell her to have a good night, shes beaming from the tip and the good feedback and I'm happy with my new ink and we wish each other a good night and I hit the road. \\n\\n\\nlater on after looking closer and actually checking it out its apperent that the placement is straight but considerably off center and there is some double lining and the lettering is a touch questionable if you look closely. also it's worth mentoning that it's a serious tattoo in memory of everybody in my life who died.\\n\\ndespite its issues and especially considering the nature of the piece, im happy with it. I had the option to wait a day for a guaranteed good piece or go with a sketcher option and I rolled the dice and this is what it came up as, that's just the way it goes sometimes. the placement is off and I could be pissed about it, but the girl placed it and moved it once at my request and I okayed the placement it ended up at. the lines aren't perfect but they look pretty good anyway, the lettering is slightly off but I think it looks good. even if I did mind, the girl was inexperienced and she did her best and she was really nice and friendly, as far as I'm concerned that makes up for it. I have plenty of fucked up tattoos, this is my nicest one so far and you wouldnt notice the mistakes unless you looked for them \\n\\nat the end of the day I'm happy with my new piece and I made the artist feel good about her work, as far as im concerned thats a win for everyone.</td>\n",

       "0   These are the three birth names I know of, and the fourth is someone who really should not have changed their last name....\\n\\n\\n#1️⃣. My mom worked with a guy named Richard Head. \\n☆ Everyone at the office did indeed call him ♤Dick Head♤ EVERYDAY!! ☆\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n#2️⃣. I went to school with a teacher named Richard Stylhard. \\n ☆ Imo a last name with the words *still* and ESPECIALLY *hard* in it, should never be associated Dick.\\n I wonder if he needs viagra or if he can get his ♧Dick Still Hard♧ on his own. ☆\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n#3️⃣. My sister went to school with a guy named Mike Hunt.\\n ☆ Three years ago I was managing a Little Caesars. \\nI got a online order for that name twice within a month. \\nBoth times when his order was ready, I yelled in the lobby, \"Order for ◇My Cunt!!\"◇\\nIt had to of been the same guy. ☆\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n#4️⃣. My step dad knows a lady named Ima. She got married &amp; changed her last name to Hoare. \\n☆ I'm guessing, she wasn't thinking. \\nTho I guarantee that first time she introduced herself as, ♡I'm A Whore,♡ she stf was doing a whole lot of thinking then!! ☆\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1   For example, I hate the feeling of when a conversation has run dry, when two people are digging for more to talk about. \\nAlso, I hate the vibe people can give off that's like \"oh my god quit talking!!\" I'm a social person, especially if you're someone I love and don't see often  I want to tell you about my life! I want you to tell me about yours! I don't want to stand in line at a food cart for 20 minutes in dead silence because it's OBVIOUS you don't want to be talking to me. \\n\\nSo ...anyway! What are some vibes you can't stand?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "2   Supongo que todo termino, aunque no lo parezca al fin después de tanto ya puedo estar tranquila, te has ido, muy posiblemente no volverás  y está bien.Lo entiendo.\\n\\nMuchas veces tengo miedo sobre lo que pueda pasar y si todo rige por el azar y llamamos buena suerte al azar cuando nos beneficia y mala suerte al azar cuando nos perjudica solo creo que el azar sin percepción le agradezco por permitirme conocerte y aún puedo decir cosas tan lindas y no se ni cómo \\nCómo pasó esto? \\nCómo te quise? \\nCómo te dejo de querer? \\nBueno no lo sé, solo te fuiste y el pasado no cambia no lo hace y lo que nos queda es seguir no te digo que seas feliz porque no se puede cuando mismo no\\nHay que ser felices en la medida que sea posible y seguir desapacio pero sin rendirse puedes ir lento y está bien puedes detenerte un momento y está bien\\nLo que no te permito es rendirte sin haber usado todas las posibilidades porque si a veces algo no mismo funciona y no es el caso estarse cayendo con la misma piedra solo inténtalo y si no pues que es lo peor que puede pasar? \\nDa miedo el futuro, mucho miedo kowaio\\nA veces espero verte ahí y no es muy confuso \\nSolo lo dejare ahí las cosas están bien cómo están y este es el fin, te lo prometo ya no intentaré nada :\") \\n\\nMe quedaré hasta el 11 de febrero que es tu cumpleaños y bueno no más las cosas son así y lo que no te mata te hace mejor \\nGracias y de nada ;v \\nYa sabes cuentas conmigo para todo aunque sé que no me llamaras cuando la pases mal pero lo digo en serio \\nY ya \\nSayonara —☆ \\nMishell-san                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "3   Anyone know of a subreddit where you can post old pictures to see if I can find the people in them? I found a tik tok where this girl  posted two camera rolls of a bunch of people and I’m curious if I can find the people in them. Four people commented on the tik tok and said that one of them may be from New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4   Lol this week has been so insanely horrible. I say that meaning I've never seen people look so done with everything because the whole everyone calling in sick is really pushing it. That's not really relevant to why I feel like I'd be a weird dad but it brings me to the whole level of just collapsing onto the couch and watching whatever is like modern family , Which is life in pieces. Don't judge me :P\\n\\nWhy are people so afraid of talking about stuff in the family? Or why do people get so weirded out talking about stuff in general? \\n\\nLike Santa, I should probably mention that where I live you usually make a deal with the neighbors and one of them plays Santa and comes over vice versa. So by age 6 I wasn't worried about Santa and whatnot, I was curious who played Santa because obviously everyone in my family was present for his visit and someone was wearing a totally fake mask...\\n\\nFirst experience I had with death was around the same age when my dad had shot a deer and got to see it laid in the trunk of the car. I can't say I remember it extremely well but I remember they eyes on the deer quite well. It looked peaceful. Yes reading that afterwards does look slightly cold but I don't know a better way to describe the eyes, it was fear or sadness, it was at peace :)\\n\\nI'm not sure when I understood how sex works, i can't see myself being older than 8 though. Why is it strange to talk about sex with your children, not children in general.  But like your son or daughter, you know they will have sex, or at least you'd hope they have sex, children and so on... \\n\\nI realise that this is probably only relatable for people that have kids or have thought about this as much as I have...\\n\\nSorry if I'm rambling it was just a philosophical thought :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

She said \"I have a 2% chance of survival but 2% isn't 0%,2% is something and I wish people knew how amazing it is\"... She came to the audition alone but when she left she had so many people rooting for her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "7   His dad lives in Taiwan and has his entire life. My partner moved here with his mom and siblings when he was 5 so they don't have a close relationship but they want one. My partner and I moved in so every time his dad called I was there. I asked if he knew we lived together and my partner was like \"oh shoot! Yeah, I should tell him\". \\n\\nHis dad wanted to have a phone call with me. I don't speak Mandarin and the dad doesn't speak English so my partner had to translate. The dad was slyly asking things about my birth but spread them in the conversation. I asked if he was trying to get my astrological info and my partner sighed and said yes and that his dad was into that stuff even though it was \"stupid\". I gave his dad my time of birth and what town I was born in and that next time we talked I wanted to know what he learned about me. The dad started talking faster and all my partner translated was that the dad was trying to say he was very precise and accurate about his research. I said cool I am looking forward to it and we scheduled a call for next week.\\n\\nWhen we hung up my partner asked me not to encourage his dad in his astrology stuff. I asked why and he said his dad has been a lot less logical since he started doing astrology as a hobby. I asked if that is hurting anything. His dad is a doctor, is he prescribing things based off the stars? He said no and chinese medicine often prescribes diet and lifestyle changes before medication anyway. I asked what was so bad about the hobby then, his dad gets joy and the downside is...? He didn't like his dad believing in something not fact based and he said their relationship took a hit so that was a negative. I said that really sounds like a problem with my partner. His dad found something he loves doing and their relationship was already strained at best. My partner held resentment and strained the relationship further. What was causing the strain, the happy dad or the unyielding son? I think he is so critical of his dad and his dad was obviously nervous of asking that he wouldn't have asked if he didn't really enjoy doing research into these things. \\n\\nThere was silence for thought and he said that he will be less critical and thanked me for talking him through my thoughts. He said he realized he was putting his own values and lifestyle on his dad which wasn't fair since his dad was happy, healthy, and independent and those are the most important things. I am happy that I have helped their relationship. There are some bad on the dad's side as well but it's a step to meeting in the middle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "8   I'm always watching shows or reading books where people have these great communities . They know the struggles the others are going through, they  live life together, and it seems really lovely and genuine. But pre-pandemic, I was always so busy. I had something every evening with my social groups. And yet, it wasn't really a community. We didn't know what was going on in each others' lives. We didn't share our struggles. The few times I did, I felt like it got shut down. I want to have that community, to build it, but I don't want to go back to the hectic nature of my pre-COVID social schedule. Anybody here got this whole thing figured out?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "9   I  work as the librarian for my former elementary school, which operates from preschool to 6th grade.\\n\\nA couple of months ago, I thought it'd be a fun idea to go find my now 8yo nephew's old ducky hand puppet that we used to entertain him when he was small and see if the little ones at the school  would like it.\\n\\nBut when I went to our storage unit and looked in the container with our old toys, the ducky puppet was gone. I don't know what we ever did with it or who has it. So I decided to see if there were any other stuffed animals in there that I could use, and I found my late big sister's old hippo doll.\\n\\nI decided to take this to work with me the following Wednesday, which is the day I have preschool coming to the library. I introduced this doll to the class as \"Mr. Hippo\", an old friend of my sister's whom I brought back here from the jungle.\\n\\nMy routine with him is simple: I read the kids a story, and while I'm reading it I have Mr. Hippo ask questions and make comments about it. Then, I let the teacher decide who was paying attention the best, and that kid gets to hold onto Mr. Hippo for the rest of their class's library visit. I do this with preschool, kindergarten, and 1st grade.\\n\\nAt first, this was a big hit with the little ones, especially preschool. They'd actually talk to this doll as if it were alive, and they'd ask me where he is if they didn't see him.\\n\\nBut lately, the kids have seem to lose interest in Mr. Hippo. I've had a few library visits where I didn't bring him out and nobody seemed to notice or care, and when I do bring him out, they don't seem as enthusiastic as they used to be.\\n\\nOne thing I tried this week that did seem to revive the interest was to hide him and have the kids search for him. I told him he was due for a dentist appointment and he was afraid of going, so he hid somewhere in the library, and I asked them to help me look for him, with the kid who found him getting to hold onto him for the rest of their library visit.\\n\\nThat got the kids interested, but I don't necessarily want to just do that all the time. What are some other ways you think I could make Mr. Hippo interesting again?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "11  These are all islands in Hawaii. \\n\\nOahu is the most populated island  with lots of development and traffic, and Maui is also the same way, but not as highly populated \\n\\nMolokai on the other hand is a very rural island  with only a small bit of development and not a single traffic light.\\n\\nHowever Kauai seems to be a perfect halfway blend of both sides. With 66,921 residents, it does have some development and traffic, but nowhere as heavily as Oahu/Maui, and most of the island has a rural feel to it which is very similar to Molokai.\\n\\nWhich of these two sides do you think Kauai is more similar to, Oahu/Maui, or Molokai?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "13  I've always been into tattoos and body modifications and I've been tattooing/piercing myself since I was a kid, when I was in high school I spent a few years living in a group home and ended up giving myself between 40 and 50 tattoos with equipment that varied from safety pins mounted in pencils with pen ink to handmade machines with proper needles and ink, eventually I landed an apprenticeship and stopped tattooing myself at the request of the artist teaching me. several years later I turn 18 and begin to draw myself a kickass tattoo to have done by an artist at the shop I was learning at as my first professional tattoo, I spent a long time working on it and between working and juggling all the other aspects of my life at the time the process stretched out and eventually I finished my drawing. a week after i gave them the drawing and we started looking to schedule something coronavirus came and with it came lockdowns and with lockdowns came the temporary closure of tattoo shops, which also stretched out far longer than expected and after the shops reopened life got in the way again and long story short I still havent gotten it done. \\n\\nyesterday was stressful and eventful and last night was pretty rough, today on a whim I remembered a different and much simpler and smaller tattoo design id had in mind for a while and called around some local shops asking about availabilities for a walk in and pretty much everywhere is booked, one place with good reviews and a professional and friendly artist answering calls tells me to call back later so I do and he tells me that it wont be possible today but tomorrow theres an opening and to call back if I'm interested, I thank him and consider waiting till tomorrow and decide to call one last shop  before deciding and as it turns out they have an availability in about two hours.\\n\\nthe woman answering the phone was friendly, but somewhat unprofessional. the website isnt great and I didnt see much artwork from the artists, I also wasnt told which artist would be available. it's also worth noting that this tattoo shop used to be in a space that was a jenky ass tattoo/piercing shop run by methheads back in the day. as you can probably imagine, I was skeptical, but I check the reviews and they're all extremely positive except for one badly written borderline incoherent review from about five years ago, so I call back and make the appointment for the opening that afternoon. \\n\\nwhen I get there their receptionist is friendly and the owner of the shop seems responsible and friendly as well, at this point I'm already a 50$ deposit in and I'm already there so it is what it is,but I'm pleasantly suprised by the place and I talk to the artist and get everything situated and then I'm getting the stencil put on. the artist had drawn a good design based on the references I'd provider and I'm happy with it and from what I see the stencil is placed well so off we go.\\n\\na few minutes in it's clear that this artist isnt very experienced, it's also apparent that the placement is a little bit off and the artist is a little bit awkward with the convorsatiom aspect of the buisness, but at this point we got lines down already and I like the design so it is what it is and in just gonna ride it out, I'm not too picky and shit happens so its whatever. I make some convorsation with the artist and she lights up a little bit sharing her interests and plans and hobbies and shes clearly concentrating on the tattoo and doing her best. we finish up, I payed for the tattoo and gave her a nice tip and compliment her work on my tattoo again and tell her to have a good night, shes beaming from the tip and the good feedback and I'm happy with my new ink and we wish each other a good night and I hit the road. \\n\\n\\nlater on after looking closer and actually checking it out its apperent that the placement is straight but considerably off center and there is some double lining and the lettering is a touch questionable if you look closely. also it's worth mentoning that it's a serious tattoo in memory of everybody in my life who died.\\n\\ndespite its issues and especially considering the nature of the piece, im happy with it. I had the option to wait a day for a guaranteed good piece or go with a sketcher option and I rolled the dice and this is what it came up as, that's just the way it goes sometimes. the placement is off and I could be pissed about it, but the girl placed it and moved it once at my request and I okayed the placement it ended up at. the lines aren't perfect but they look pretty good anyway, the lettering is slightly off but I think it looks good. even if I did mind, the girl was inexperienced and she did her best and she was really nice and friendly, as far as I'm concerned that makes up for it. I have plenty of fucked up tattoos, this is my nicest one so far and you wouldnt notice the mistakes unless you looked for them \\n\\nat the end of the day I'm happy with my new piece and I made the artist feel good about her work, as far as im concerned thats a win for everyone.  \n",
       "14  When I was a kid I would trade cds with my friends and the trade would be based on how many good songs were on the cds being traded. It was also the quality of the songs too and hype based around the record. I trade guitar pedals on another sub here and it’s pretty similar lol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "15  Something that I used to do years ago was a few times a year host a celebration for a holiday from another country that wasn't usual to the US  or a holiday from a religion that I didn't know much about  or even funny little celebrations that happen . I like to cook something traditional and just did a little spiel about the holiday or celebration. But I've lost my list! I was hoping to start in January 2022 and do a once-a-month dinner. I just think it's a great way to learn about new cultures and religions and is fun and delicious. \\n\\nDo you know of any fun / unusual holidays? I would love to learn about celebrations from around the globe. It's so fun to research AND I usually get to try out new recipes!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Be a blessing and joy to others today, you never know who’s struggling out there!\\n\\n“There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour. A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.”\\n‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭21:20-23‬ ‭KJV‬‬ \\n\\nGospel of the grace of God: I Corinthians 15: 1-4 KJV / Romans 3:25 KJV❤️                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "19  Anytime I find a new sub I immediately browse by top all-time to see what I'm in for and if it's worth subbing. A lot of the time all-time posts seem to have all-time comments. Unfortunately most of them are over 6 months old and are archived. So I've started going to the commenters latest post and upvoting that as a retroactive upvote for something they've said a while ago.\\n\\n  This post from fightporn is what made me think of this. The comment section had me dying and I felt the commenters needed proper recognition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "20  Why when, “is it every to late is asked”.it’s generally seen for some sports ur just a genetic freak or have been groomed to do it. So u can do ok but never that good. Yet with art it seems there’s no limit. I mean there’s  piano players who train all there life’s, to become concert piano players. No one who didn’t train as a kid will do that. I mean at some point u will always be bad at something or average. If u didn’t have the tools and a good environment, you’re basically fucked. You will never be above average and definitely pro at anything. If it’s for fun who cares. It just art seems underestimated. Most brilliant painters in history always started young as well as,sculptures,singers,dancers,and especially musicians. This also I feel applies to the modern day. At some point ur just fucked. Tho it’s not all bad.at least if u fall into said category you have nothing to lose. Any thoughts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "21  It's kind of a trend I notice with my friend, Everytime I win in basketball like a pickup game or anything they would always say an excuse or never talk about it, but Everytime I lose or don't have my rythym in they keep rubbing it in my face and feel kind of overwhelmed since I have nothing to say, but at the same time that friend also gave me a job at Levi's, but it's like with him I never hear something positive about me, the other friends I have I feel like I don't want to talk to them since one did something illegal which I won't say, I feel like it kind of hurts my confidence since losses feel more worse when I lose to him even if I'm a better player than them but don't do so well or teammates can't make points.

       "23  I know  \\([  has already made its rounds on the interwebs, but my partner shared it with me a couple days ago.  \\n\\nI got a little verklempt  and got caught up in reflecting on where I am, and where those around me are, and everything going on in the world.  There are people crying for lost loved ones, people isolated who need someone just to reach out and say \"Hey, I feel you.\" Hunger and longing.  And I like to think that for all the sorrows felt right now there are at least as many joys, if not more.   New babies cooing, a lovers familiar embrace, a warm cup of coffee to start the winters day.\\n\\nSo my conversation starter: What verse would you add to The Keep Going Song?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "24  I  was born on Kauai  in 2002, but moved to Molokai  in 2008.\\n\\nFrom what I've experienced throughout my life, kids on Molokai are kinda cliquey, and while mostly nice to each other, they're really rough on kids who are new to the island, whether they be from other islands or the mainland.\\n\\nThe only exception is if you already have connections to people on Molokai . But even that doesn't guarantee anything. I remember taking my little cousins from Kauai and Oahu to a community Christmas dance at the rec center a few years back, and a lot of the kids were rough/harassing them.\\n\\nThe irony is, Molokai's nickname is the friendly isle, meaning we're known for our hospitality and kindness. However, I'll be honest and say I've met more nicer kids on the other islands I've been on throughout my life  than I ever did on Molokai, and I traveled around the state a lot as a kid.
