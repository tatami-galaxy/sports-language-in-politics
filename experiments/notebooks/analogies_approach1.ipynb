       "[\"Yeah we totally got played by receiving accurate information we didn't previously have.  I voted for Hillary but her camp has not been gracious at all.  Not an ounce of accountability for the proven favoring of Hillary during the primaries.  And you're still blaming US for Trump instead of taking responsibility for the fact that you guys put up a weak candidate instead of the most popular politician in the country and lost an impossible to lose election against Trump of all people.  Have you actually read any of those e-mails?  Her camp was literally trying to make Trump the Republican nominee, because they thought he'd be the easiest to beat.  They messed up BAD and I'm tired of being blamed when I sucked it up and did what I was supposed to do.  I doubt you'd extend us the same courtesy.\",\n",
       " \"I recall reading in a National Review article that the Dems didn't win the majority of whites in a presidential election once between LBJ and Obama. Never got around to fact checking that, but it would be very telling if true.\",\n",
       " \"Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it didn't happen. Look at the Dems from Reagan onward; every time the GOP lost a presidential election, they did a purity test claiming the nominee wasn't 'conservative enough' and the party (especially those in Congress) take a step to the Right, with the Dems doing more to reach across the aisle. Case in point is the debate between Reagan and H.W. Bush where both speak positively about illegal immigrants\",\n",
       " \"wearing a black lives matter shirt isn't promoting a side in the elections any more than wearing a nascar hat is. being liked by a lot of people who would vote democrat does not make something illegal electioneering. it has to specifically promote a candidate or party to be banned.\",\n",
       " 'Yea, sure, whatever you say...\\n\\nHe’s a former U.S. Naval Reserve intelligence officer, combat veteran, and Harvard grad who won his last election in a landslide victory. He’s well spoken and just so happens to be gay. \\n\\nSo, who are you?',\n",
       " \"I don't disagree. I will get behind whoever the candidate is, just as I have my entire adult life. to clarify, I am NOT planning on voting against Biden, or even sitting out the election if he's the candidate, but at the same time I'm *also* going to try to put up the candidate that I think has the best chance of convincing *other* people to vote for them, for the same reason: getting trump tf out. we're all on the same side, dems   :)\",\n",
       " \"I don't think he has what it takes to get down in the muck in order to win a Presidential election. He's a gentle giant and his talents are better utilized outside of the buffoonery that is DC politics. He's way too gentle to roll around in the mud and I attribute that to his Christian beliefs. Something I aspire to but do not achieve at all. Turning the other cheek is not something I do well.\",\n",
       " \"He looks electable because democrats are treating each other with kid gloves and pretending that this election will be about policy. Biden won't be even slightly electable once the attack ads from republicans start. But they want him so they will hold off until after the primary.\",\n",
       " 'You’re only making my case. Those ‘discrepancies’ are completely inconsequential and were only found after recounts - and yet that still wasn’t enough to make Trump happy, as he wanted nothing less than Georgia’s electoral slate completely overturned. Most of those don’t have anything to do with the presidential election, either. Why hype them up if you know they’re meaningless?',\n",
       " \"Moderates aren't going anywhere. Again, you're assuming the majority of the GOP is loud, far right, and obstructionist. The statistics don't support that. What you have is a vocal minority trying to hijack a party, and doing it rather successfully. \\n\\nThe problem is that minority has no ability to win a presidential election. Absolutely none. It'll never happen. The republican party can either cave to the extremists that you seem to think make up a majority (they don't), or split. Neither option is great. So either the GOP continues to slide right and alienates more and more moderates (eventually making them totally irrelevant), or the party splits (RINOS and far right) and both become irrelevant against a unified democratic party until the moderate group regains strength. \\n\\nI think option 1 is more likely. The further the crazies drag the party to the right, the less relevant the GOP will become. You may enjoy the chaos of removing moderates from your party, but you do so at the cost of further insignificance.\"]"

       "[\"I don't think Reagan is an apt comparison for Trump.  Obviously any national political candidate is going to have a huge cross-section of voters, but in 2016 huge chunk of people who voted for Trump because they were sick of the neocon/neoliberal Uniparty which arguably *started* with Reagan and had controlled the White House ever since.  We saw this on the Democrats side as well with Bernie, but Bernie couldn't get over the top against Hillary, while the larger field of Republicans allowed Trump to take over before voters coalesced around an establishment candidate.  People forget that that entire election was defined by establishment antipathy (particularly unhappiness with the DNC primaries), and that a not-insignificant portion of Bernie supporters ultimately voted for Trump.\\n\\nNow we've got the most Uniparty candidate in history in the White House, whose entire platform was that he isn't Trump.  The anti-Uniparty sentiment hasn't faded at all- indeed, Trump got 74 million votes- in 2020 it was just countered by an even bigger wave of anti-Trump sentiment.  But people would be huge fools to discount it or think that it was a passing trend.\\n\\nIf Biden doesn't deliver (even in the face of the inevitable GOP opposition), 2024 will look just like 2016 in terms of voter sentiment, but instead of Trump and Bernie we'll likely see 2 new, more shrewd candidates who are able to galvanize the Trump/Bernie base without all of the crazy shit Trump says.\",\n",

There is always some gray because politicians all universally lie about ability, which is different than intent. Ie: trump can say he will build the wall, but he can’t actually unilaterally do so and honor the balance of powers, but “I will try to negotiate a position where I trade political favors to build as much of the wall as my opponents will let me get away with” is not a catchy slogan.',\n",

Pelosi has done a ton to advance both people of color and women and even women of color into leadership.

And it doesn't help that the group AOC aligns with, Justice Democrats, is issuing primary challengers against a number of black caucus members. Challenges that they'll probably lose across the board because most of those reps are insanely popular at home. At the end of the day, Pelosi is saying what she is not to suppress women of color, but because she has a 235 member caucus to maintain. And to keep that caucus in power (which is the ONLY check against Trump in Washington right now), she has to maintain that majority.
